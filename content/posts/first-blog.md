From 2006 till 2018 I had my [Ham Radio blog](https://blog.ok1cdj.com) onÂ  blogger in Czech Language. Then I was active only on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ok1cdj).
I decided to restart my publication about my current projects. The blog will be in English only and there will be longer technical articles. News about propagation, QSOs, and contests will be kept
on twitter.
